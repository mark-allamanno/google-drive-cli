    Searches for a file with a given term present in its filename. So if I were to say 'search Mario' it would go
    through all files and print out the absolute paths to files who contain the keyword Mario in them.

    Alternatively you can also use the -f flag if you arent unsure of the name or sub-term of a file in which case it
    will use fuzzy string matching to attempt to find all files names who contain close but not absolutely the same
    string.

    Usage:
        search [options] <TERM>

    Options:
        -f, --fuzzy     Use fuzzy string matching if you arent sure of the exact name or sub-name
