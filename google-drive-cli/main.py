    A function to parse user input into a friendly form using the docopt library. We firstly need to split the user
    input on spaces unless in quotation marks (files can have spaces in names) so we need to use shlex to do this and
    subsequently separate teh command given from the arguments. Then we can attempt to return the given command along
    with the arguments parsed out by docopt. We use a simply little trick where we get the get the function pointer for
    the given command and can use __doc__ to get the docstring for docopt parsing with the arguments being everything
    in the user input that is not the command.
